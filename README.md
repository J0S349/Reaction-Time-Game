# Reaction-Time-Game 

This game is designed to stimulate brains as to whether they can count the number of pictures their are. There are 5 preloaded pictures found in the files and when the program runs, it will choose a random number of them. It will then proceed to cut the image in half and will display it in the GUI. The now divided images will be moving around the screen all while the user tries to keep track of how many whole pictures there are. The user is also given a certain amount of time as to give them some pressure. In order for this program to work correctly, your system should have pygame install already. Here is a link that is a good place to start looking for: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
